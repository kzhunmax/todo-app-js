# TODO App with JavaScript

## Description
This is a simple TODO application built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The app allows you to:
- Add tasks to your TODO list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks you no longer need.
- **Save your tasks** even after reloading the page or closing the browser.

The app uses **localStorage** to store your tasks, ensuring that your data persists across page reloads and browser sessions.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Check off tasks when they're done.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
- **Persistent Storage**: Your tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they won't disappear after refreshing or closing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works
1. **Adding a Task**: Type your task in the input field and press "Add" or hit Enter.
2. **Completing a Task**: Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed.
3. **Deleting a Task**: Click the delete button (üóëÔ∏è) next to a task to remove it.
4. **Data Persistence**: All tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they remain available even after reloading the page.
